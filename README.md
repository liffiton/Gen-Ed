Gen-Ed: Generative AI for Education
===================================

Gen-Ed is a framework for building web applications that use generative AI
(LLMs) for education (i.e., organized around instructors and their classes of
students for use in teaching and learning contexts).

The framework provides most of the common functionality any application of this
type might need, including:

- Authentication, including single-sign-on from Google, Github, and Microsoft.
- Class enrollment, with separate instructor and student roles.
- Connecting to LMSes via LTI (for automatic authentication and enrolling).
- Class management and data export.
- Admin interfaces.

The repository also contains two applications that are built on Gen-Ed:

1. **CodeHelp** [1,2]: A tool for assisting students in computer science
   classes without giving them solution code. <https://codehelp.app/>

2. **Starburst**: A topic-exploration tool for writing assignments.

Install
-------

Requires Python 3.10 or higher.

1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment.
   (E.g., `python3 -m venv venv; source venv/bin/activate`)

2. Install the Gen-Ed package and bundled applications in 'editable' mode:

```sh
pip install -e .
```


Set Up an Application
---------------------

1. In the root of the repository, create `.env` and populate it with
   environment variables to configure the application.  See `.env.test` for a
   list of all available variables.  The required variables are:
   - `FLASK_INSTANCE_PATH`: Path to an instance folder for storing the database
     and other persistent files.  Commonly set to `instance`.
   - `SECRET_KEY`: Used to sign session cookies.  Generate a secure random
     string for this.
   - `SYSTEM_API_KEY`: Your LLM API key to be used for queries outside of a
     class context (e.g. for free queries).
   - `SYSTEM_MODEL_SHORTNAME`: Name from the application databse of the model
     to be used outside of a class context.  `GPT-4.1 mini` is a good default.
   - `DEFAULT_CLASS_MODEL_SHORTNAME`: Name from the application database for
     the default model to be used in new classes (can be configured after
     creating the class).  `GPT-4.1 mini` is a good default.

*Optionally*, if you want to allow logins from 3rd party authentication
providers, set any of the following pairs with IDs/secrets obtained from
registering your application with the given provider:

```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=[...]
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=[...]
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=[...]
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=[...]
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID=[...]
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET=[...]
```

Then, to set up an application (CodeHelp, for example):

2. Initialize database:

```sh
flask --app codehelp initdb
```

3. Create at least one admin user:

```sh
flask --app codehelp newuser --admin [username]
```

This will create and display a randomly-generated password.
To change the password:

```sh
flask --app codehelp setpassword [username]
```

4. (Optional) To serve files from `/.well-known` (for domain verification,
   etc.), place the files in a `.well-known` directory inside the Flask
   instance folder.


### (Optional) Database Export Encryption

Database backups (from migrations) and downloads (from the admin interface) can
optionally be encrypted using age encryption. To enable encryption:

1. Generate an encryption keypair using either SSH (you might also choose to
   use an existing SSH keypair) or [rage](https://github.com/str4d/rage):
   ```sh
   # SSH key
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f backup_key

   # Age key
   rage-keygen
   ```

2. Add the public key (contents of `backup_key.pub` for an SSH keypair) to
   `.env` as `AGE_PUBLIC_KEY`

3. Keep the private key (`backup_key` in an SSH keypair) secure and offline -
   it should never be present on the server.

4. When you need to decrypt a backup, you can use
   [rage](https://github.com/str4d/rage):
   ```sh
   rage -d -i backup_key backup.db.age -o backup.db
   ```


Running an Application
----------------------

For example, to run the CodeHelp app:

```sh
flask --app codehelp run

# or, during development:
flask --app codehelp --debug run
```

When deploying an application in production, do not use the development server
used by `flask ... run`.  See [the Flask
documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/deploying/) for
production server options.


Developing
----------

See `DEVELOPING.md` for additional instructions and information for developing
an application and/or contributing to the project.
