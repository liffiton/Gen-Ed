          <h1>CodeHelp is a coding and CS assistant.</h1>
          <p>It can explain issues and answer questions about your code and CS concepts.  It uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">large language models (LLMs)</a> to understand code and natural language queries and respond in natural language as well.</p>
          <p>You can:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ask how to start writing a program.</li>
            <li>Get an explanation of a confusing error message.</li>
            <li>Ask why your code isn't working correctly in a particular spot.</li>
            <li>Learn more about specific syntax, functions, or techniques in your programming language.</li>
            <li>... and a lot more.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>For instructors:</h2>
          <p>CodeHelp helps your students any time they have a question, and it provides help <i>without writing code</i> for them.  It is made specifically to guide and explain rather than provide solution code.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Incorporate LLMs into your teaching in a managed way, offering your students the eductional benefits LLMs can provide without compromising their learning.</li>
            <li>See your students' queries to gain insights into what they are working on and the sorts of questions they are asking.</li>
            <li>Tailor responses to your class by providing keywords that responses should not use (e.g. <code>sum()</code> if you want students practicing for loops instead of using a built-in function).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can share CodeHelp with everyone in your class with a simple link.  There are two options:</p>

              <li>Everyone will log in automatically via a link from your course page.</li>

          <h3>Pricing</h3>
          <p>CodeHelp itself does not take payment, but the OpenAI LLMs it uses are not free.  We will ask you to provide an OpenAI API key to be used for your students' queries.</p>
          <p>Costs are low: OpenAI will charge you roughly US$0.002 for each query made with the GPT-3.5 model (GPT-4 is roughly 15x more expensive).  If your students use CodeHelp regularly and average 50 queries each over a semester (higher than the average we've observed), your total costs would be roughly $0.10 per student (or $1.50 per student if using GPT-4).</p>

              issue: "I want this function to print the word, excluding the character.",
              response: "<p>The error message you are seeing is an Attribute Error, which means that the object you are trying to access does not have the attribute or method you are trying to use. In this case, the object is the string <code>word</code> and the attribute you are trying to use is <code>remove()</code>. The <code>remove()</code> method is not a valid method for strings, so you are getting this error.</p><p>You can use the <code>replace()</code> method instead. This method takes two parameters: the substring you want to replace and the substring you want to replace it with. In this case, you want to replace the character with an empty string. To do this, you can pass an empty string as the second parameter to the <code>replace()</code> method. This will remove the character from the string.</p><p>For example, if you have a string <code>word = &#39;Hello&#39;</code> and a character <code>character = &#39;l&#39;</code>, you can remove the character from the string by calling <code>word.replace(character, &#39;&#39;)</code>. This will return a new string with the character removed, <code>&#39;Heo&#39;</code>.</p>",

              issue: "How do I write code to evaluate whether an integer is a prime number?",
              response: "<p>To determine whether an integer is a prime number, you can use a loop to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. One way to do this is to loop through all numbers from 2 to the integer&#39;s square root, checking if the integer is divisible by each number. If it is divisible by any number, it is not a prime number. Otherwise, it is a prime number.</p><p>It&#39;s important to note that there are more efficient algorithms for checking prime numbers, but this approach should work for small integers.</p><p>Remember to consider edge cases, such as negative integers and 0 or 1, which are not prime numbers.</p><p>Let me know if you have any further questions or if there&#39;s anything else I can help you with!</p>",

              response: "<p>Thank you for reaching out for assistance with your Python code. Based on the error message you provided, it seems that the issue is with the <code>__init__</code> method in your <code>Gamer</code> class. The error message is telling you that this method takes only one argument, but you are passing two arguments to it. </p><p>In Python, the <code>__init__</code> method is a special method that is called when an object is created from a class. It is used to initialize the object's attributes. When defining the <code>__init__</code> method, you need to include the <code>self</code> parameter as the first parameter, which refers to the object being created. </p><p>In your code, you have only included the <code>name</code> parameter in the <code>__init__</code> method, but you have not included the <code>self</code> parameter. This is causing the error message you are seeing. To fix this, you need to add the <code>self</code> parameter as the first parameter in the <code>__init__</code> method. </p><p>I hope this explanation helps you understand the issue and how to fix it. Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.</p>",

              response: "<p>You can use a <code>while</code> loop to iterate over the characters in the string in reverse order. To do this, you can use the <code>len()</code> function to get the length of the string, and use the <code>range()</code> function to generate a sequence of numbers from the length of the string down to 0. Then you can use the <code>str[index]</code> syntax to access each character in the string. </p><p>To help you understand how this works, think about the following example: </p><p>Say you have a string <code>my_str = \"Hello World\"</code>. You can use the <code>len()</code> function to get the length of the string, which is 11. Then you can use the <code>range()</code> function to generate a sequence of numbers from 11 down to 0. This sequence of numbers will represent the indices of the characters in the string. Finally, you can use the <code>str[index]</code> syntax to access each character in the string. </p><p>Using this approach, you can iterate over the characters in the string in reverse order.
